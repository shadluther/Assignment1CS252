Radius = 7.5
Expected Output
Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689
Area is = 176.71458676442586

5.	Write a Java program to compute the area of a polygon.  
Area of a polygon = (n*s^2)/(4*tan(Ï€/n))
where n is n-sided polygon and s is the length of a side
Input Data:
Input the number of sides on the polygon: 7
Input the length of one of the sides: 6
Expected Output
